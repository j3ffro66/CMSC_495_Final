Originally developed as a group project for CMSC 495 at the University of Maryland Global Campus, our motivation for creating this application stemmed from the frustration with the limited availability of free and open-source to-do list managers. We aimed to build a developer-friendly and user-friendly application, designed to be intuitive and require minimal learning.

For your convenience and security, we highly recommend saving your password to a trusted password manager. In the event that you forget your password or encounter any other issues, please open an issue, and our dedicated team of developers will be glad to assist you.
